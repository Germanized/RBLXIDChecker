       - `createMainTab()`: Creates the main tab with buttons for checking catalog IDs and displaying results.
       - `createCreditsTab()`: Creates the credits tab displaying the creator's name.
       - `check_predefined_catalog_ids()`: Starts the worker to check predefined catalog IDs.
       - `check_raw_catalog_ids()`: Starts the worker to check catalog IDs entered by the user.
       - `start_worker()`: Starts the background worker for checking catalog IDs.
       - `append_output()`: Appends results to the output text area.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Uses Seleniumâ€™s exception handling to manage errors during web scraping.
   - Displays errors and status updates in the GUI.
